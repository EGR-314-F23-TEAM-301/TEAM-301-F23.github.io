Description:

This station provides precise weather conditions at all times, at home
or garden. The LCD color display showcases a variety of information. The
outdoor sensor is wirelessly connected to the console and the console
enables a wide range of weather information to be accessed. The 5-in-1
outdoor sensor transmits current information about the indoor
temperature and humidity, outside temperature and humidity, wind speed
and direction. There is also a rain gauge, min/max recordings, wind
chill and dew point alarm (high & low), a weather forecast based on air
pressure, calendar and a display of the current moon phase. All this is
visible on the color display (base station), via the solar powered
transmitter.

**Team 301**

Date of Creation: 8/27/23

Document Version 1.0

**Introduction**

The task that we have been given is to design and develop a product that
will involve systems that can respond to the environment by using serial
sensing and actuation in a system. The environmental data that the
product reads also needs to communicate to the internet over WiFi using
the MQTT protocol. In our product, we must also involve at least one
motor that will be controlled by a motor controller that communicates to
the I2C or SPI-based protocol.

**Objectives**

The goal that we want to achieve is to create a product that is highly
interactable for the user while also maintaining a user friendly
interface. We also want our product to be safe to handle.

**Stakeholders**

**Target group.** Upper-middle to high-class individuals between the age
of 25 - 50. They will be looking for the latest and upcoming gadgets.

**Target purchaser.** Homeowners, property owners/managers, or companies
who are interested in upgrading and modernizing their window shade
equipment.

**Customer Service.** Preferably easy-to-repair, components that can be
recycled and made from quality materials, and provide clear and quick
instructions.

**Retailers.** Prefers high quality products that can withstand a
variety of conditions - including everyday use, changes in temperature,
humidity, and pressure.

**Use Cases**

*User Story #1: Sierra*

Sierra is a 27 year old stay-at-home mom of three kids all under 7 years
old. During the day, the sun beams through the windows, making it
uncomfortably hot and disrupting nap time. Manual blinds and curtains
cause a safety risk as the kids like to pull on them and play with the
cords. Sierra recently purchased AutoShades for her kids' windows and
has programmed it to lower and pull-up during nap times and certain
temperatures. AutoShades has significantly decreased the temperature
levels in the kids' room and increased nap times.

The functionality of AutoShades has made Sierra buy the product for the
rest of the windows in her home. She is so pleased with the outcome that
she has started to tell her friends all about it.

*User Story #2: Keith*

Keith is the assistant to a CEO of a tech startup. He suggested
purchasing AutoShades for the office since the floor to ceiling windows
make it hard to work when the sun shines through. When the temperature
outside hits a certain point, all the shades will pull down. Thanks to
AutoShade, the office space is now glare free and employees are able to
focus more.

Customers visiting the company have noticed the new shades and are
impressed with the technology. Some are even thinking of letting their
employers know about the product.
