Our upstairs landing was staying very hot all day. This has been perfect so far. The temperature difference in our house has changed drastically. This color is Jacquard Coffee and we have cream trim on all our moldings and it goes perfectly. The other side that faces the outside is white.” <br>  - "So easy to install and it works great. Consumer service contacted me within 24 hours when I had a question.” <br> - “Really nice blinds. Install was really simple and they look great installed.

| - “They look quite fragile and much less appealing than in the product picture on Amazon web page. Blinds came without any installation instructions. If, like I did, installed the blinds inside the window frame - removing them is super difficult. One of the USB cables (1 out of 5) was damaged and cant be used.” <br> - “Connecting the hub to our 2.4/5G network was super difficult. Device can't connect to combined 2.4/5G Wifi, rather it needs a dedicated 2.4G network. After several hours configuring my WiFi, I got the hub connected. But that turned out to be a waste of time. The app is done for old iOS devices. App itself doesn't add any value to the standard remote we ordered as well. Mechanically the WiFi hub feels like a 99 cent cheap piece of plastic and is ugly.” <br> - “Don't let the customizable ordering fool you into believing you're paying for quality. The blinds will arrive and be impossible to program into alexa or their app. The instructions are unclear.” | - Product did not cater to customers'technological compatibility (explicit) <br> - Product is robust and visually appealing (explicit) <br> - App used for remote access is useful and user friendly (explicit) <br> - Clear and easy to follow instructions(explicit) |

| - “Note that Manual operation time is controlled by the "How Long" setting in Program operation. If you need to run the pump for less time than this setting, you tap the pump button to start it, and tap again when you want it to stop. If you try to run it longer than the Program operation setting, it will shut off after the Programmed operation's setting, and you will have to tap it again to resume pumping.” <br> - I could either set it and forget it with a predefined schedule, or monitor it remotely, even triggering extra watering on demand if needed. Powered by USB and/or Batteries (to address power outages), the system will automatically switch to the appropriate power source.” <br> - “Very easy to set up.

| - “I set it for 5 min every 24 hours and woke up and it dumped 13 gallons of water into my three plants in my grow tent. Let's just say I wasn’t expecting this. When the pump shuts off it continues to pull water and doesn’t stop this is after a lot of testing there is no automatic shut off valve to stop the flow once the pump starts it” <br> - “The app has step-by-step instructions on how to set up the WiFi connection, but they are difficult to understand. It is not clear if batteries need to be installed or not, or if it will work either way. The instructions are written in an illogical way. I had to make 4 attempts at pairing the unit before it finally succeeded, and I have no idea why it finally succeeded, especially since it did not switch between rapid and slow blinks, as the instructions stated it would. During some of the attempts it had asked me to pair my phone to a "smart..." WiFi network, which I never saw, while during the final attempt it did not ask me to do this.” <br> - “The single-color left LED can communicate 5 different messages, depending on how it blinks. This makes for a very cryptic user interface, especially since there is not even a blink guide next to the LED.

| - “I’ve only had these up for a week. I got two of them to monitor temperature in two separate work locations in two different cities. Super easy to set up and so far work great. I exported data to Excel with no issues. Real quick and easy to do so. I use alerts too and they alert me every time the temperature reaches a specific level.” | - Easy set up (explicit) <br> - Ability to export data into Excel (explicit) <br> - Monitor multiple devices in multiple locations through app (explicit) |

BTW, I was curious to see how closely the 2 of them matched when sitting side by side for a day - temperature varied at most .1 to .2 degree, humidity .1 to .2 percent.. I’m very pleased. I ran the 1st one for 2 months at the 10 minute upload interval for highest accuracy and the 1.5V alkaline batteries had only dropped to 1.47V when I got back. So battery performance is good too - I’ve now configured both units to upload at 30 minute intervals simultaneously and I’m guessing batteries will go at least a year.” | - Long battery life (latent) <br> - Accurate data readings (explicit) <br> - Ability to specify upload intervals (explicit) |

| - “ I have had 4 of these since late last year and all 4 are now garbage. I purchased them for my temp and permanent greenhouse, my dad’s greenhouse, and to monitor my indoor grow room. They work great for the first couple months, but much more than that they just start reading erratic temps, refuse to connect via Bluetooth or wifi, and corrode like crazy. Number 1 started throwing crazy temps and going off line while IN my house, where the temp never got above 80 and the humidity never got above 70%. Number 2 started reading 265° in my greenhouse, then dropped to 32°, then to 165° when I brought it inside to check and change the batteries. Number 3’s back panel melted even though the greenhouse never rose above 105, and number 4, in the pic, was wet inside and corroded even though the hatch was hatch side down on a metal grate with wide slats so that it would never be in standing water.” | - Product data stays accurate even with consistent use (latent) <br> - No safety risks (latent) <br> - Strong bluetooth and wifi connection (explicit) |
| - “I bought this to monitor the temp in my garage freezer. This thing is CONSTANTLY losing connection to the Wi-Fi. It should and does not give any kind of notification when the signal is lost. It also only gives one brief notification when the temp gets too high. IMO it should make my phone go nuts until I acknowledge the notification. Only one quick beep is useless if I am saying mowing the grass……..I called Govee today to see if there was some kind of update or something they could look at. The guy tells me it is not supposed to go in the freezer. WTH? That is what I bought it for. I remember searching for and buying it specifically for the freezer when I picked it up a couple of years ago. Ridiculous!!! I guess it is worthless and I will have to search for something else to buy.” | - Strong wifi connection(explicit) <br> - Consistent alerts when data is out of range (latent) <br> - Ability to withstand a wide range of temperatures(latent). |
| - “If you are buying this because you want temperature alerts while you are away, you will be disappointed! Do not buy! First of all, notifications only work on Bluetooth -- while you are at home with your device! So there is no way to receive notifications while you are away. You can check the temperature while you are away by opening the app on your phone, to see if the temperature is within your desired range. But this is not quick -- it takes 5-10 seconds for the app to update with the recent data from the device. Second, the device only sends alerts via app notification, not email or text. And you only get one notification when the temp drops out of the range you specify. There is no way to escalate based on the amount of time the device has been out of temperature range, or to set a more severe temperature threshold." | - Real time data tracking (explicit) <br> - Ability to send continuous alerts as numbers go out of range (latent) <br> - Ability to see real time updates on app even when far from home (latent) |

I did have an issue with the outdoor temperature and humidity not displaying on the screen. Customer service was very responsive with suggestions to resolve the issue.I have had spiders get in and spin webs on the rain collection arm." <br> - "I bought this weather station because I had a Bresser brand that gave me connection problems and I wanted another one with another frequency.Positive aspects: the connection works perfectly, the data seems reliable, it seems more resistant than the Bresser, the screen is more beautiful with colors and lighting and it can be connected to the current so as not to waste batteries.Negative aspects: in comparison, it lacks many functionalities, it has a record of maximums and minimums but only for 24 hours and it does not specify what time and day it occurred. In addition, it does not have a record to see the data of the last 24 hours, that is, it only gives you the data of the moment." <br> - "It will be delivered well packaged. The structure and installation are well described and easy to implement. The function meets our requirements. The screen is large and clear.What we can't predict is the durability of the outdoor unit. It's made of plastic. In our area (Andalusia/1000m) there is a lot of sun and strong wind." | - Data and parameters can be quickly fed back(explicit) <br> - Stable wireless connection(explicit) <br> - Rechargeable instead of disposable batteries(explicit) <br> - Displays need to be bright and durable(latent) <br> - Weather data can be stored(explicit) <br> - Instrument parameters can be adjusted manually(latent) <br> - Easy to assemble and operate(explicit) |

| - "The batteries in the outdoor unit will be very difficult to replace while on the roof. There is a small screw to remove that is almost guaranteed to fall down and roll off the roof, and then the batteries have to go up into the unit with the correct polarity, and you will have to lay under it looking up to see the installation direction. Battery replacement from the side would be a lot better. Amended to one star. <br> - "This weather station has pretty severe mounting limitations if you are mounting it on a "vertical" service. If this surface is vertical, you can only mount it on an east or west facing surface, as the mounting hardware included doesn't let you rotate the unit around to point the outdoor sensor in the correct direction." <br> - "It certainly has a lot of functions (mostly useless), and my estimate is around a hundred. To pull up all this information, you have basically three buttons located around the edges, so be careful if you have to pick it up to read it or shift the rain gage scale. If you push the wrong button or push them in the wrong sequence, you could wind up erasing data. No menu and no help from the manual." | - Internal parts are easy to replace(explicit) <br> - Large battery capacity(latent) <br> - The station can be mounted at any angle(explicit) <br> - The units can be rotated(explicit) <br> - All functions should be integrated and categorized(explicit) <br> - Wrong actions on system can be undone(explicit) <br> - The instruction is simple and easy to understand(latent) <br> - Longer life cycle(latent) |

**Introduction**

The task that we have been given is to design and develop a product that
will involve systems that can respond to the environment by using serial
sensing and actuation in a system. The environmental data that the
product reads also needs to communicate to the internet over WiFi using
the MQTT protocol. In our product, we must also involve at least one
motor that will be controlled by a motor controller that communicates to
the I2C or SPI-based protocol.

**Objectives**

The goal that we want to achieve is to create a product that is highly
interactable for the user while also maintaining a user friendly
interface. We also want our product to be safe to handle.

**Stakeholders**

**Target group.** Upper-middle to high-class individuals between the age
of 25 - 50. They will be looking for the latest and upcoming gadgets.

**Target purchaser.** Homeowners, property owners/managers, or companies
who are interested in upgrading and modernizing their window shade
equipment.

**Customer Service.** Preferably easy-to-repair, components that can be
recycled and made from quality materials, and provide clear and quick
instructions.

**Retailers.** Prefers high quality products that can withstand a
variety of conditions - including everyday use, changes in temperature,
humidity, and pressure.

**Use Cases**

*User Story #1: Sierra*

Sierra is a 27 year old stay-at-home mom of three kids all under 7 years
old. During the day, the sun beams through the windows, making it
uncomfortably hot and disrupting nap time. Manual blinds and curtains
cause a safety risk as the kids like to pull on them and play with the
cords. Sierra recently purchased AutoShades for her kids' windows and
has programmed it to lower and pull-up during nap times and certain
temperatures. AutoShades has significantly decreased the temperature
levels in the kids' room and increased nap times.

The functionality of AutoShades has made Sierra buy the product for the
rest of the windows in her home. She is so pleased with the outcome that
she has started to tell her friends all about it.

*User Story #2: Keith*

Keith is the assistant to a CEO of a tech startup. He suggested
purchasing AutoShades for the office since the floor to ceiling windows
make it hard to work when the sun shines through. When the temperature
outside hits a certain point, all the shades will pull down. Thanks to
AutoShade, the office space is now glare free and employees are able to
focus more.

Customers visiting the company have noticed the new shades and are
impressed with the technology. Some are even thinking of letting their
employers know about the product.
