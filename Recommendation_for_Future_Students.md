**Recommendations for Future Students**
- 
The recommendations that the team have for future students in order to be successful in the course are as follows:

**Tip 1**
-
Deadlines - Deadlines are crucial in this course as the ICC’s, individual assignments, and team assignments all build on each other. The ICC’s and individual assignments are there to help you be successful when it comes to your team assignments. Even though some assignments get pushed further back, it is still important to do your best to meet the original deadline or else it’ll pile onto your workload eventually.

**Tip 2**
-
Network - There are plenty of students that have taken the course previously and are more than willing to lend a helping hand to help you succeed. No matter how big or small the task is, there will always be other students that have taken the course or have similar knowledge to the course material. Don’t be afraid to make connections.

**Tip 3**
-
Datasheet - Understanding the datasheet for a component is very important for your team project as it is the only thing that’ll tell you whether a component is compatible with your project or subsystem. You don’t want to be that person that orders the wrong component and you have to research for another component that will only set you back on your progress. Even if a part may be a cheaper alternative, sometimes quality takes over quantity. 

**Tip 4**
-
Team members - Choose your team members strategically. Pick people that you know that you have good chemistry with as you will be working with them for the whole semester. Be sure that you all can establish good communication skills and work ethic. 

**Tip 5**
-
Using resources - Use the resources that are available to you like the professor, teaching team, other groups, the engineering website. All of these resources are there to help you become successful.
