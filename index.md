**Introduction**

Window shade products have become a staple in modern home environments. Some products are designed to be manually operated and some products are powered by a system of actuators to raise and lower the window shade when provided with the customers input. However, some products don't provide customers the ability to input a set of prefereces as to when the user wants to raise and lower the shade without being present in the household. There have been countless customers being present in their household and the setting of their home is either too hot or too cold. Not only does it make it an uncomfotable environment for the user but it also takes a toll on a customers electricity bill to keep the house hot or cold with the thermostat.

To tackle this issue, we came up with a solution to the window shade product industry. Our team is looking to take on this issue by developing an automated window shade device that will raise and lower the shade based off of temperature, humidity, and amount of light readings.

## [1.0 Team Organization](Team_Organization.md)
Here, you'll find out more about Team 301.
## [2.0 User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements](UserNeeds_Benchmarking_Requirements.md)
The team user needs, benchmarking, and requirements can be found here. Here we go more into depth on what the team wants to accomplish like what kind of product we want to create, our target audience, etc.
## [3.0 Design Ideation](Design_Ideation.md)
In our design ideation, the team talks a little more about the brainstorming processes and how they were able to come up with there top three overall designs, the functionality of the device, the safety features, etc. 
## [4.0 Selected Design](Selected_Design.md)
The selected design gives a little more detail of what our final product design is and how it'll function and the things the team wish to accomplish with the final design.
## [5.0 Block Diagram](Block_Diagram.md)
Block diagrams are used to show a breakdown of what subsystems will be incorporated into the design, what components will be connected to each other, etc. Here, it talks about the final block diagram of our final product and the features that stayed the same or changed and why those actions have been taken upon.
## [6.0 Component Selection](Component_Selection.md)
For our final product, the team used a variety of different components that were both project requirements and requirements for the teams final design. Here it talks about the components we used and why we decided to go with the selected components. 
## [7.0 Final Software Implementation](Software_Implementation.md)
After making changes to our software proposal, here we have the teams final software implementation and the coding that was done to the final product. Here, you can view the step-by-step coding process that was applied to our final device while also mentioning some features that stayed the same or were changed and why they were changed.
## [8.0 Final Hardware Implementation](Hardware_Implementation.md)
For our final hardware implementation, it talks about the final board design and goes into detail about what makes up the team board and the features that the board contains. You can also find more information about what actions were taken to get to their current standing.
## [9.0 System Verification](System_Verification.md)
Here, you can view the spreadsheet that was used to demonstrate our team system verification that was checked by the teaching staff.
## [10.0 Lessons Learned](Lessons_Learned.md)
After wrapping things up, the team regrouped together to talk about the lessons that they learned as a group and individually.
## [11.0 Recommendation for Future Students](Recommendation_for_Future_Students.md)
Here, we would like to give future students some helpful tips that might help them be successful when taking this course and hopefully carry this on to rest of their college career.
