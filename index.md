**Introduction**

Window shade products have become a staple in modern home environments. Some products are designed to be manually operated and some products are powered by a system of actuators to raise and lower the window shade when provided with the customers input. However, some products don't provide customers the ability to input a set of prefereces as to when the user wants to raise and lower the shade without being present in the household. There have been countless times of customers being present in the household and the setting of their household is either too hot or too cold. Not only does it make it an uncomfotable environment for the user but it also takes a toll on a customers electricity bill to keep the house hot or cold with the thermostat.

To tackle this issue, we came up with a solution to the window shade product industry.
