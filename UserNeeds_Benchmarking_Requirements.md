# 2.0 User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements 

## 2.1 Existing Products, Jamboard Progress, User Needs 

Conducted research on products that relate to the project description and already exist

Gathered information on positive and negative feedback from all researched products

Took the feedback we gathered and created our first jamboard listing our user needs that we want our product to fulfill

Categorized our user needs and created our first modified version of our jamboard into three categories

  - Safety
  - Design
  - Functionality

Then we ranked our first modified jamboard on a scale of 1-3 where 3 was our most important rating and 1 was our least important rating

## 2.2 Product Requirements

The objective that we want to achieve for this product is to create a product that is highly intractable for the user while also maintaining a user friendly interface. We also want our product to be safe to handle and original. So after careful consideration, we turned our user needs into product requirements by applying specifications to the needs of our users that would either meet or exceed our needs. In order to keep track if these requirements are being met, a benchmark will be set up to determine whether if a requirement is met, it will then pass that benchmark.

Some of the product requirement aspects that we extracted from our user needs are as follows:

_Hardware/Product Design_

- DC Motor, power source
- Product should be unique and not sold in the market
- Product should be energy efficient

_Software/Functionality_

- Product should communicate data over WiFi
- I2C or SPI
- Product should use at least 2 environmental series sensors
  
_Interactivity & User Experience_

- Product should be highly interactive for the user
- Product should maintain a user friednly user interface
- Product should have the ability to be checked remotely

_Customization_

- Product should be a universal fit
- Product should be easy to assemble
- Product should be tailored around customer needs
  
_Manufacturing_

- Product should be manufactured from quality materials
- Prodcuts should come with extra parts in case of damage
- Product should be tester and approved by each team member
  

_Safety_

- Product should be safe to operate
- Product should not contain any sharp edges
- Product should be functioning at a safe/low voltage range
