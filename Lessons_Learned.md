**Lessons Learned**
- 
After working together for the semester with everything coming to a close, here are a few lessons that the team learned together and would like to reflect on it.

**Lesson 1**
-
The most important lesson learned from this project was to manage our time wisely. With many deadlines to keep track of, it was very easy to miss an assignment, some of which were detrimental to the next steps in our project. 

**Lesson 2**
-
Communication is also equally important to ensure that the project goes as planned. If there is a change in plans or a team member is struggling on an assignment, communicating with the team can help streamline the process.

**Lesson 3**
-
Ensuring that schematics are not only updated, but labeled with correct values for an easier referencing and board population.

**Lesson 4**
-
When selecting a microcontroller, carefully read specifications to ensure that it meets project guidelines and code examples.

**Lesson 5**
-
Ordering extra parts are important in the case that they break, get damaged, or lost.

**Lesson 6**
-
Update project files as changes are made and make sure that all team members are aware of the changes being made. This ensures that there are no gaps and misunderstandings.

**Lesson 7**
-
When choosing components, choose parts that you are familiar with. With the lack of time to finish the project, having familiar components will cut the research work in half.

**Lesson 8**
-
Ask questions on assignments. No matter how big or small the assignment is, some assignments have not been updated and the only solution to that is to ask around to see what other students have done to do the assignment. 

**Lesson 9**
-
Office hours will be your best friend. A lot of the course material will have you spending a good amount of time in office hours to get credit for the assignments, more specifically the checkoffs for the ICCâ€™s and team checkoffs. 

**Lesson 10**
-
Spend the extra money on other tools that will help you on your assignments. Tools like a soldering kit will be a good start as you will spend a lot of time soldering components onto the team board. The Peralta labs can be busy on certain days leaving no tools available to you.
